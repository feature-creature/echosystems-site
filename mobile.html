        <p class="statement" style="margin-top:50px;">The rearranging of reality comes as no surprise. Every day glitches, in memory, emotions, stocks, politics, identity and power, permeate the experiences we take for granted. The future has become polarised. An oasis of possibilities diverges from a self-inflicted, perennial wasteland. Tribes, parties and institutions fight in the never-ending capitalist war for your attention, affection and awareness (or lack thereof). </p> 

<p class="statement">As these half-waking premonitions haunt our present day, it feels vital to populate the technological sphere with diversity and constructive dissonance, through taking ownership of the processes and systems in place. To build and re-imagine platforms held together by multilateralism, a system of connections that is bigger than the sum of its parts, and speaks to the widest range of future dimensions. </p>

<p class="statement">‘Echosystems’ reflects this fragile, glitchy reality/utopia. Through the integration and assimilation of juxtaposing ecosystems, based on sprawling concepts such as time, affect, ecology, embodiment, transmission and witnessing, the exhibition binds these together, creating a highly intricate, enriching network, and galvanizing a symbiotic yet splintered understanding. </p> 

<p class="statement">The virtual opposite of the infamous echo-chambers, ‘Echosystems’ represents both a duality and dichotomy, carrying polyglot echoes beyond established networks while acting as a ghostly portal to a plural future, informing rather than subverting, coalescing instead of categorizing. </p>
            <p class="statement">If systems thinking is a hallmark of computer science, these artists fold a myriad of inputs and experiences into their own artistic processes and methods, merging the occult with the scientific, the speculative with the ecological, and the embodied with the coded.</p>

<p class="statement">Through the creation and re-definition of human and computer agency, and through the construction of original interactive phenomena, symbioses are born and nurtured, hoping to be extrapolated and implemented with the same reckless disciplinary abandon, pioneering new perspectives and re-coding the glitches.
